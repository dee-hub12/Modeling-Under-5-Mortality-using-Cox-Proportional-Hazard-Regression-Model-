# Modeling-Under-5-Mortality-using-Cox-Proportional-Hazard-Regression-Model-
Ghana, like many other developing nations in Africa, grapples with a substantial under-five mortality rate. As a result, it falls short of fulfilling the United Nations' sustainable and millennium development goals, which are aimed at improving child health and reducing child mortality. To lay the groundwork for effective strategies and well-informed policy interventions, it is essential to utilize robust statistical models capable of pinpointing the primary factors significantly impacting under-five mortality rates. In this study, we employ the Cox proportional hazard regression model to model the under-five mortality in Ghana using data from the IPUMS-DHS from 2009 to 2014. The study's findings indicate several critical determinants that contribute to the alarming under-five mortality rate in Ghana. Specifically, marital status and the current employment status are associated with decreasing the mortality for under-five while the educational level of the mother, the year of the child's birth, the gender of the child, and the economic status of the household have been identified as substantial factors driving the high under-five mortality rate in Ghana. On the contrary, marital status and current employment status have shown associations with a reduction in under-five mortality.
